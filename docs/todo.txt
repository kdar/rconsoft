Monitor rcon_password. If someone changes it, update the config. But you should probably
keep a default_rcon_password to revert to if the new password doesn't work anymore.

The tracker class needs a way to register what cvars to track so on startup it can
query for those cvars and keep them (ontop of tracking them as they change).

Tell in chat the score of last half. My idea is that you start keeping score after a lo3. Then
if you were to lo3 again, it tells you the score of last half. You could make it complicated and do
the entire game and such, but there are a lot of variables to consider. Such as someone restarting
the round once (happens often if someone was afk) or you lo3 multiple times before the real lo3.

If users are already in the server and rconsoft boots up, get their ip. Probably via "stat".

Allow rconsoft to shutdown. Plugins should be able to hook into the shutdown event and
rconsoft should wait for them. Maybe there should also be a timeout where rconsoft
will shutdown anyways.
